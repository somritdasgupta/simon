This is a simple implementation of the classic Simon game built using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery. The game consists of four colored buttons: red, blue, green and yellow. The game randomly generates a sequence of colors and the player must repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order. The game starts with a sequence of one color and each time the player successfully completes the sequence, the game adds one more color to the sequence.

## Demo

## How to play

1. Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. The game will play a sequence of colors.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.
4. If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game will play another sequence with one more color.
5. If you make a mistake, the game will end and you can try again by pressing the "Start" button.
